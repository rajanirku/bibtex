	of semantic preservation) of a compiler from Cminor (a C-like imperative
	language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the Coq proof assistant
	both for programming the compiler and for proving its correctness.
	Such a certified compiler is useful in the context of formal methods
	applied to the certification of critical software: the certification
	of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties proved on the
	source code hold for the executable compiled code as well.},
